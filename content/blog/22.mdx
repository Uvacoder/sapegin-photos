Since I’ve made [this mobile photo](https://www.instagram.com/p/BdxPrGCBeH_/) last January, I was waiting for another foggy day. Fog in Berlin is rare and it took me more than a year.

Initially I wanted to repeat the same composition as a year ago, but the fog wasn’t strong enough, so I had to use a long lens to make fog more visible. And stack two polarizers with a neutral density filter to achieve at least 30 seconds exposure in daytime.

Here are a few photos I’ve made that day. I hope you enjoy them!
