I often shoot with my Canon 6D and my iPhone at the same time: sometimes the same compositions, sometimes different, sometimes just a back of my Canon. I often use these pictures, processed in VSCO Cam or Darkroom, as a color inspiration when I process Canon photos. Or, for example, I shoot at long exposure and after looking at iPhone photo I realise that short exposure works better.
