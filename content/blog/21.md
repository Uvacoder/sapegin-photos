Aaron Reed has posted [six of this recent photos](https://www.facebook.com/aaron.reed.184/posts/10214205087613670) before and after editing. I thought that I can do the same thing here. So here are my recent photos.

On most of them changes are also, like on Aaronâ€™s examples, minimal. All work done in Lightroom and Photoshop.
