Hi! Iâ€™m Artem, a web developer and a passionate photographer living in Berlin, Germany. I shoot nature, cities and my dogs.

I write about photography at [my blog](/blog), show my photos at [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/@sapegin) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/sapegin/).

I also send [a newsletter](/subscribe) where I share my new photos and articles.
