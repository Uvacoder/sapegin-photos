I’ve been blogging about photography since I started taking my first pictures in 2004. But it has always been in Russian. This is my first blog post about photography in English.

I make photos when I’m not making web applications at work. I’ve always considered myself as a landscape photographer but it seems that now I’m more travel and dog photographer. Or sometimes photographer of my traveling dogs. Nature is still my passion though I haven’t seen it much in the past few years.

I don’t know how often I’ll write here. I haven’t been very productive in my Russian blog last few years. Will see.

I hope you’ll enjoy my photos and posts and I’ll be happy if you:
