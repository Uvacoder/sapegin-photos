I bought my first camera in 2004, a film Canon EOS 300V with a kit lens. Then I added a Sigma 70-300, a cheap telephoto lens, that was occasionally able to make a sharp photo.

At that time I was shooting everything without thinking much. But I’ve made a few photos that I’m not ashamed of to this day.
