One November Sunday morning I went to a park and was surprised to see almost monochrome trees in strong backlight. It was a bit tricky to shoot though: it’s a fenced pond in a public park so I had to shoot with a telephoto lens over the fence and the highest position of my tripod wasn’t enough — I had to retouch a few grass leaves at the bottom of the frame later.
