The Art of Photography by Ted Forbes is my favorite photography podcast. The Artist Series is a [crowdfunded](http://fundaop.com/) series of short documentaries about modern photographers.

There are three of them right now and a few more are planned. Each episode is about 10 minutes long and features one photographer. You can watch them free [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGEE7pGLuppS6Wn-FHetQPfo0QbeDiTYe).

Even if you haven’t heard of Alexey Titarenko, William Wegman or Laura Wilson watch anyway — all episodes are great.
