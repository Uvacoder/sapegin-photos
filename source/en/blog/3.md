I’ve seen the news that Steve [McCurry removes people](http://petapixel.com/2016/05/06/botched-steve-mccurry-print-leads-photoshop-scandal/) from his photos more than once in my feed already.

I think it’s more complicated than people on internet like to think.

It’s fine to remove people and other stuff from a landscape or a cityscape, people aren’t important for a photograph. If you remove people, remove them all.

But if people are crucial part of a photograph, if you’re making a composition of people and waiting for a perfect moment, then removing people means you haven’t waited for that memoment, you haven’t made that photograph. It should be just boring for any serious photographer.

And that stitching artifacts people found on McCurry’s photos — just a shameful work, no matter what you think about the morality of photo manipulation.
